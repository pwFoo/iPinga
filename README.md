# iPinga
PHP Mini Framework - MVC, simple, elegant

## Synopsis

iPinga is a powerful PHP mini-framework with a extremely small footprint, 
committed to simplicity and productivity.  It is a full-stack web application 
framework, written in PHP, supporting v5.3 and beyond.  iPinga is based on 
the model-view-controller development architecture.  

Most PHP developers need a fast and reliable environment without everything that 
larger frameworks include.  iPinga is built with this in mind and excels 
because of its simplicity and ease of rapid development.
